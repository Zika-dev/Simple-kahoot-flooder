# Kahoot flooder that runs on local pc

- # How to use

You just run the main.py file

- # Warning

Since kahoot has made it so that a player gets kicked when the player closes the active kahoot tab, it has to have all of the tabs open at the same time and im not sure how to bypass this.

### This means that it will use a large amount of ram memory if you want to flood with a lot of bots.

- # requirements
- Selenium
- Python 3.9
